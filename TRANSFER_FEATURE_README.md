# Product Transfer Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive product transfer feature to the KaphongERP system, allowing users to create transfer slips that can include up to 20 different products.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Add New Transfer Form
- **Component**: `WarehouseAddTransferForm.php`
- **View**: `warehouse-add-transfer-form.blade.php`
- **Location**: `app/Livewire/Warehouse/`

### 2. Key Features
- **Multi-product transfers**: Support for up to 20 products per transfer
- **Dynamic product selection**: Real-time product information loading
- **Automatic calculations**: Cost calculations and totals
- **Form validation**: Comprehensive validation for all fields
- **Modal interface**: Clean, user-friendly modal form
- **Database integration**: Full integration with existing database structure

### 3. Form Fields
- **Transfer Information**:
  - Company Name (required)
  - Transfer Date (required)
  - Requested By (required)
  - Deliver Name (optional)
  - Origin Warehouse (required)
  - Destination Warehouse (required)
  - Tax ID (optional)
  - Phone (optional)

- **Product Details** (up to 20 products):
  - Product Selection (dropdown)
  - Quantity (numeric)

### 4. Database Integration
The feature integrates with existing models:
- `TransferSlip` - Main transfer record
- `TransferSlipDetail` - Individual product details
- `Product` - Product information
- `Warehouse` - Warehouse selection
- `TransferSlipStatus` - Transfer status management

### 5. Business Logic

- **Transaction Safety**: Database transactions ensure data integrity

### 6. User Interface
- **Modal Form**: Clean, responsive modal interface
- **Dynamic Product Rows**: Add/remove product rows as needed

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
